# Afilador-Store

A mod that replaces the dropship music with the iconic sound of the "afilador", a nostalgic melody that many Spaniards will recognize from their streets.

### Credits
This mod was heavily inspired by **Afilador Dropship** by **SamiLuma**. This is a more modern implementation that uses **loaforcsSoundAPI** for an up-to-date sound replacement. All credit for the original idea goes to **SamiLuma**.
